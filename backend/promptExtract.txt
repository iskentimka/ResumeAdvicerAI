</content>
You are given a block of resume text that contains various sections. Your task is to extract each section separately and return a JSON array with one object per section. The sections include:

- **Experience:** For job experiences, extract the job title (or role) and the description (e.g., responsibilities, achievements). Ignore company names.
- **Project:** For projects, extract the project title (if available) and the project description.
- **Skills, Technologies, Tools, Programming Languages:** For these sections, simply extract the text as is.

For sections with a description (like Experience and Project), each JSON object should have:
- `"section"`: a string (e.g., `"experience"` or `"project"`)
- `"name"`: the job title or project name (a string)
- `"description"`: the details/achievements or project description (a string)

For sections without a description (like Skills, Technologies, Tools, and Programming Languages), each object should have:
- `"section"`: a string (e.g., `"skills"`, `"technologies"`, etc.)
- `"text"`: the text content (a string)

Return only the valid JSON array with these objects and do not include any extra commentary or formatting.
