You are provided with a JSON object representing a section of a resume. The JSON object has the following keys:
- "name": the title of the section (e.g., "Skills", "Project", "Experience")
- "text": the content of that section

You are also given a job description. Your task is to slightly modify the "text" field so that it better aligns with the job description. Do not include any extra formatting, explanations, or a JSON structure in your response â€“ simply output the revised text.

Guidelines:
- For sections like "Skills", "Technologies", "Tools", or "Programming Languages", add or adjust relevant items if needed.
- For "Experience" or "Project" sections, modify the text (e.g., job responsibilities, project description) slightly so it fits the job requirements. Do not include company names or unrelated details.
- Output only the revised text as a plain string.

Example 1:
Input:
{
    "name": "Project",
    "text": "The game on Python."
}
Job description:
Need a developer with 3 years Java and Spring experience.
Output:
The game was written on Java and Spring.

Example 2:
Input:
{
    "name": "Skills",
    "text": "Python, Java"
}
Job description:
Need a developer with 3 years Java and Spring experience.
Output:
