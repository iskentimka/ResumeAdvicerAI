You are given a JSON array where each object represents a text run extracted from a DOCX file. Each object has the following structure:
{
  "text": "<text content>",
  "paragraph": <paragraph_number>,
  "run": <run_number>
}

You are also provided with a job description. Your task is to modify the text content of the runs according to the job description's requirements while preserving each run's "paragraph" and "run" values. If a particular run does not need to be modified, output it unchanged. Return your answer as a JSON array of objects in the same format.

For example:
